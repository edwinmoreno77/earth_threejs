# Earth project with React and threeJS

This project is an interactive 3D simulation of the Earth rotating, with the Moon orbiting around it and a starry space background. Inspired by the Google Earth experience, it allows users to change the Earth's direction through interaction. The application is built with React for the interface and Three.js for 3D rendering, combining interactivity with realistic visuals.
